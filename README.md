In question 1 we define a function space(x) to give a space of desired position between two values to be printed.
In question 2 we use the recursive function calling of factorial and a sine power series function to calculate the value of sine of a number till the desirable number of terms.
In question 3 we use the recursive function calling to find the fibonacci series of the numbers from 1 to the user input numbers.
In question 4 we define several functions for reading values, calculation, the different operations and for displaying result to form a simple calculator.
